# Parser Lab Session 3 - PEG progrogramming language

## Task
Build PEG parser for (reasonable subset of) some programming language
- Input is (unannotated) source code
- Output should be parse tree (make it an actual tree, but no other semantic actions needed)
- Error handling (or code generation) is not required, but appreciated

## Prerequisites

## Build

## Usage

## Accepted programs

## Tool used for solution

## Statements about final CFG
